      After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), 
      Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. <br>
      His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), 
      were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. <br>
      After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction.
