  <h2>About</h2>
  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>
    The ancient Indian kingdom of Chedi had its capital at Suktimati, which was located at Sagar during contemporary times. <br>
    The history of Sagar District before 1022 A.D. is generally unknown; after that, records are available. <br>
    Sagar was under the rule of Ahir Rajas and their capital was at Garhpehra. <br>
    In 1660, Udenshah, founded the present town of Sagar.
  </p>
  <p>
    After 1735, the city came under the rule of the Peshwas. <br>
    When Chhatrasal gave a region (subha) to Bajirao, he appointed Govindpant Kher (later Bundele) as an administrator. <br>
    Govindpant founded the city of Sagar next to the Sagar Lake and made the city as his capital. <br>
    In 1818, a large part of the Sagar district was ceded by Peshwa Baji Rao II to the British East India Company.  <br>
    Administratively, the position of Sagar and the neighboring territories underwent frequent changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Saugor territory was first placed under the superintendent of Political Affairs of Bundelkhand. <br>
    Later, in 1820, this area, called the 'Saugor and Nerbudda Territories,' was placed under the administration of an agent to the governor-general. <br>
    The region fell under the North-Western Province, following its constitution in 1835. <br>
    In 1842 occurred the Bundela rising, the quelling of which demanded more direct attention by the Governor-General. <br>
    But the order was restored in the following year, and the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were again placed under the political control of an Agent named to the Governor-General. <br>
    The arrangement, however, was not found to be satisfactory, and these territories were once again restored to the North-Western Provinces in 1853. <br>
    After that in 1861, the Saugor and Nerbudda territories and the Nagpur state formed a Commissioner's Province called Central Provinces.
